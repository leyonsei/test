# Hello World

### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 is one of my favorites because it had a lot to deal with converting measurements or 
    converting in general. With my knowledge on knowing how to do lab 4, I can use it to help me convert 
    other measurements in other classes that I am taking. 

* Lab 5

    lab 5, part 2 was my favorite because we get to apply many if-else statements into our code. 
    I considered myself to be really good with if-else statements so while doing part 2 of lab 5 I 
    felt extremely confident in my skill. I was able to apply the skills that I learned from this 
    lab to many future labs.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 is also my favorite lab since it demonstrates modular programming where different 
    elements of our program are defined in different files. I find myself having a lot of trouble 
    trying to understand how to do this in class. With lab 10, I was able to have hands- on experience 
    doing modular programming so I know what part that I needed to work on.
